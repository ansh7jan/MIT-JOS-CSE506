Challenge 1(5 points) Change color to 
All modern terminal emulators support ANSI escapce sequences to show colored text.
In our case we just used "\x1b[31m]" for red color to be shown in the terminal.
In our approach, we tested this escape sequence usage on both: putty as well as on ubuntu terminal with white background. For both, it gave successful results.
Code snippet for the same: cprintf("%s red", "\x1b[31m");
From this line on, color 'red' will be used for text to be displayed on the terminal/shell screen.
