MIT-JOS-CSE506
==============
This is implementation of Operating System kernel features in JOS kernel (which is developed at MIT) as taught in Stony Brook University's CSE506 - Operating System course described in detail on the course webpage at http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~porter/courses/cse506/f14/

From the course webpage: JOS can be thought of as an exokernel, where the kernel implements a minimal set of core functionality that safely exports hardware resources to applications. These low-level kernel interfaces may be inconvenient for user processes to use directly, so user processes will make use of a "library operating system" (libos) to abstract these low-level exported resources into more convenient programming abstractions.

The JOS operating system implementation included following lab work. The details of each lab are available at http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~porter/courses/cse506/f14/labs.html

Lab 0: Raw JOS code
Lab 1: x86 assembly, boot loader
Lab 2: Virtual Memory
Lab 3: Processes/environments
Lab 4: Multiprogramming and fork
Lab 5: File System
Lab 6: Network driver
Lab 7: Final project

Each lab was provided with skeleton code for JOS operating system, allowing us to do the key implementation as described in each lab.

Each branch contains the completed code for the corresponding Lab.
